# Goldfish
###### Stockfish's very distant and not so bright cousin

I am building some sort of chess program. The end vision is to be able to play (and hopefully lose) against the Goldfish engine in a GUI. 

This is meant as a project to work on as practice/just for the fun of it. If you for some odd reason would like to contribute, you are more than welcome.
