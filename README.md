# Goldfish
###### Stockfish's very distant and not so bright cousin

This is a UCI chess engine. The projects current end vision is to be able to play and hopefully lose against the Goldfish engine in a GUI. 

This is meant as a project to work on as practice/just for the fun of it. Contributions are welcome if you feel like it.
